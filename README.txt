MINIMIX
=======
by Zulko


Minimix is a minimalistic program that lets you assign one sound
to each key of you typing keyboard.
You can then use your typing keyboard as a mix table or as a proper
instrument.

The documentation is still to write. In the meantime, see the documentation
of the different functions.

minimix.py : Main function (depends only on pygame)
tools.py : Functions to create keyboard configurations easily
sound.py : Functions to process sounds (like pitch shifting)
quick.py : Implements quick versions of the functions in tool.py and sound.py
