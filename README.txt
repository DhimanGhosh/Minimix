by Zulko


Minimix is a minimalistic program that lets you assign one sound
to each key of you typing keyboard, in order to use your it as a
mix table or as a proper musical instrument.

The documentation is still to be written. In the meantime, see the documentation
of the different functions. See the examples (which are well documented)

minimix.py : Main function (depends only on pygame, and could be used alone).
tools.py : Functions to create keyboard configurations easily
sound.py : Functions to process sounds (like pitch shifting)
quick.py : Implements quick versions of the functions in tool.py and sound.py
